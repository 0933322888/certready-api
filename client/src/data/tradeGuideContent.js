A neutralizing shampoo with a mildly acidic pH of 4.5–5.5 closes the cuticle, stops the chemical process, and helps restore the hair's natural pH balance (4.5–5.5).

        explanation: "Low elasticity indicates compromised hair structure — the cortex cannot adequately stretch and return. Perming low-elasticity hair without preparation risks breakage during processing. The correct approach is to perform a strand test to assess viability, recommend a conditioning or protein treatment to rebuild strength, and then re-evaluate. Using a stronger solution would worsen damage.",

        question: "Which cutting technique removes bulk and weight from the interior of a section without changing the perimeter length?",
        options: ["Blunt cutting", "Slide cutting", "Point cutting", "Slicing / notching"],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "Slicing (also called notching) involves inserting the open shears into the interior of a subsection and sliding them down the strand, removing internal bulk while leaving the perimeter length intact. Blunt cutting creates a solid, defined perimeter line. Point cutting removes bulk at the ends. Slide cutting removes bulk while adding movement along the length.",
