This corresponds to MWA B (22% of the Red Seal exam), which is the second-largest section and tests the foundational precision work that determines whether the finished weldment meets drawing requirements.',

                                    text: 'Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), commonly called stick welding, is one of the most widely used welding processes in the world. An electric arc is struck between a flux-coated consumable electrode and the base metal; the arc melts both the electrode and the base metal to form the weld pool. The flux coating on the electrode serves multiple functions: it produces a shielding gas cloud that protects the molten weld metal from atmospheric contamination, forms a slag blanket that further protects and shapes the weld bead, and provides deoxidizers and alloying elements that refine the weld metal chemistry. SMAW is highly portable, requires minimal equipment, and is tolerant of surface contamination and outdoor conditions — making it indispensable for field maintenance, structural steel, pressure vessel repair and pipeline welding.',
